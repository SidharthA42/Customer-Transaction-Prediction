# Customer-Transaction-Prediction
In the Customer Transaction Prediction project, the goal was to develop a predictive model to anticipate whether a customer would engage in a particular transaction or not. Leveraging machine learning techniques, data analysis, and feature engineering, this project aimed to provide insights into customer behavior and improve decision-making for businesses. Finally I created a machine learning  model using classification algorithms which has 90% accuracy.
